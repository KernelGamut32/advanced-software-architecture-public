Execute the lab available at https://www.javatpoint.com/facade-pattern. You can use Java (as called out in the link) or another language if youâ€™re more comfortable.

As an alternative, for an added challenge, execute the lab available at https://gist.github.com/DavidGinzberg/b9cb42c9748122146aca#file-6_facadelab-md. Use the link above (or other sites for additional information on the Facade Pattern).
