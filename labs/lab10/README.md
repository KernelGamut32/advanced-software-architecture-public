# LAB 10

Execute the lab available at https://www.javatpoint.com/abstract-factory-pattern. You can use Java (as called out in the link) or another language if youâ€™re more comfortable.

As an alternative, for an added challenge, enhance the lab available at https://gist.github.com/DavidGinzberg/b9cb42c9748122146aca#file-1_factorylab-md to include an AbstractFactory class that can be used for generating either an Employee Factory or Logger Factory based on string input of either "Employee" or "Logger". Use the link above (or other sites for additional information on the Abstract Factory Pattern).
