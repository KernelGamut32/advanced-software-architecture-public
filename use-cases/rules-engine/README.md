# Rules Engine - Use Case

Your team has been tasked with creating a new rules engine for tax assessment and reporting. For each order that passes through your digital storefront, you are required to assess taxes and report calculated tax amounts in accordance with each municipality's specific rates and rules. Furthermore, groups of municipalities roll up into required province-specific reporting that has to happen as part of the same process.

Because regulations are constantly changing, it should be as quick and painless as possible to update the rules for each municipality and province when required. Ideally, business users would be able to make those updates via a UI without involving the engineers.
