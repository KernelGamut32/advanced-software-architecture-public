# Data Mart - Use Case

Your company includes several branches across the nation where company associates engage with representatives from large corporations to submit orders for products provide by your organization. Your team has been tasked with creating a process that can aggregate data from all of the branches into a centralized data lake in the Cloud. This comprehensive dataset will then be used for analysis and intelligence gathering (Machine Learning) to train models to make inferences about corporate customer habits from different parts of the country.

The application used to record the details of the orders submitted by associates on behalf of corporation points of contact is a wizard-based application. Associates walk through each step of the wizard while on the phone with a contact, inputting details about the order and, if the deal gets closed, guiding them through to a final payment step and schedule of delivery for the order.

Your company is interested in gaining intelligence about the following:

* How much time each step in the wizard takes
* Which step in the wizard a potential customer makes it to in the order process while on the phone with the associate
* Volumes of different product type purchased by a given customer
* Volumes of different product type purchased by region of the country
